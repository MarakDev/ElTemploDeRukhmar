# El Templo De Rukhmar
A game of exploration in a hidden temple. Your objective is to scape of the dangerous temple using your magic compass to search the exit.

## How it was made
This game was made by me and Kerus in two days for the [Insanity Jam](https://itch.io/jam/insanity-jam-1).I was the programmer, while he created the sprites and music.
The game was made entirely in Godot.

## What I implemented
The game features simple top-down movement and a compass mechanic.
